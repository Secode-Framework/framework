## About Secode

> **Note:** This repository contains the core code of the Secode framework. If you want to build an application using Secode, visit the main [Secode repository](https://github.com/secode/secode).

Secode is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable, creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Secode attempts to take the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in the majority of web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://secode.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://secode.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://secode.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://secode.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://secode.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://secode.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://secode.com/docs/broadcasting).

Secode is accessible, yet powerful, providing tools needed for large, robust applications. A superb combination of simplicity, elegance, and innovation gives you a complete toolset required to build any application with which you are tasked.
